# Notes on all of mathematics

This is my attempt at making organised notes on maths in all the fields that I learn. I am an undergraduate student in an integrated masters course, and I write these notes as I learn stuff. 


## Structure

The notes are made on LaTeX. The diagrams in the document are made on inkscape and exported as pdfTeX. All the diagrams go in `Figures/`. 

For every field I have made `\part` in `math_notes.tex` and each part has a directory with the same name. The `sections` associated to the part each have a TeX file in that directory. All these files are imported in the `math_notes.tex` file.
