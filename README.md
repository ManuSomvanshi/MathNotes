# Notes on all of mathematics

This is my attempt at making organised notes on maths in all the fields that I learn. I am an undergraduate student in an integrated masters course, and I write these notes as I learn stuff. 

## Download

If you just want to read the notes download the `math_notes.pdf` file. If you wish to edit the notes for yourself, install git and enter the following command on the terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/ManuSomvanshi/MathNotes`

## Structure

The notes are made on LaTeX. The diagrams in the document are made on inkscape and exported as pdfTeX. All the diagrams go in `Figures/`. 

For every field I have made `\part` in `math_notes.tex` and each part has a directory with the same name. The `sections` associated to the part each have a TeX file in that directory. All these files are imported in the `math_notes.tex` file.

## Issues

If you find any proofs or statements which you think are wrong or can be written more clearly, please raise an issue here with the corrected statement. Also if you have a better method for proving some proposition or theorem you can raise an issue providing the new proof.
