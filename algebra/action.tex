\section{Group Actions}
\begin{definition}
  The action of a group $G$ on a set $S$ is a map $G\times S\to S$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    ex = x \And (g_1g_2)x = g_1(g_2x),\ \forall\ x\in S
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
  The action of $S_n$ on $\{1,...,n\}$ is given by $(\sigma, x) \mapsto \sigma(x)$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then the action of $H$ on $G$ given by $(h,g) \mapsto hg$ is called left translation.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then the action $(h,g) \mapsto hgh^{-1}$ is called conjugation.
\end{example}
\begin{theorem}
  Let $G$ act on a set $S$. The relation defined by:
  \begin{align*}
    x\sim x' \iff gx = x'\ \text{for some $g\in G$} 
  \end{align*}
  is an equivalence relation.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Clearly $x\sim x$ since $ex = x$. Suppose $x\sim y$. Then there exists $g$ such that $gx = y$. Multiplying by $g^{-1}$, $g^{-1}y = x$ and thus $y\sim x$. Suppose that $x\sim y$ and $y\sim z$. Then there exists $g$ and $h$ such that:
  \begin{align*}
    gx = y &\And hy = z\\
    \implies h(gx) &= z\\
    \implies (hg)x &= z\\
    \implies x &\sim z
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
  The equivalence classes of $\sim$ are called orbits of $G$ on $S$. The oribit of $G$ on $x\in S$ is denoted as $\bar{x}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
  Let $G$ act on $S$. Then $G_x = \{g\in G\ |\ gx=x\}$ is a subgroup of $G$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $g_1,g_2 \in G_x$, then
  \begin{align*}
    g_1 x &= x \And g_2 x = x\\
    \implies (g_1g_2)x &= g_1(g_2 x) = g_1 x = x.  
  \end{align*}
  Thus $G_x$ is closed. Suppose $gx=x$ then $g^{-1}x = x$. Therefore $G_x$ is a subgroup.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
  The subgroup $G_x$ is called the stabilizer.
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
  The cardinality of $\bar{x}$ is $i_{G}(G_x)$.
\end{proposition}
